[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) has taken frontend styling by storm, it’s not quite CSS-in-JS but can provide many of the same benefits without having to write a lot of boilerplate code. In my opinion works really well with React!

## Why tailwind?

I am a recent convert to tailwind despite knowing of it for a long time – mainly due to the fact that I was already using a utility CSS framework [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/).

Tachyons has many of the same benefits and works in a very similar way.

If you have seen the utility styles approach and thought it was horrible I felt the same way initially.

What changed my mind was persevering with it and realising how much faster I could style websites.

This is particularly benefitial when adding margins and padding when reusing components in different locations. The other great benefit is theming and sticking to a subset of colours.

Constraints imposed on design make it a lot faster to build UIs and often tend to make the overall feel and rythym more consistent.

### Benefits of tailwind vs. tachyons

With the switch to tailwind I did notice some major improvements over tachyons:

- Responsive prefixes like `flex flex-col md:flex-row` are super helpful and even `hover:` and `focus:` psuedo selectors make interactive styling a breeze.
- Tight integration with Post CSS, purge CSS and the whole node.js ecosystem
- Easy overrides and customising your base styles are simple with `tailwind.config.js`

Overall I’m really happy with tailwind, even comparing with emotion and styled-components.

Couple tailwind with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or any other React based framework and you can create components for each element in your design, enabling you to reuse the lengthy class names easily and avoid repetition.

*If you have any concerns about performance (I initially did), turns out, compression algorithms like GZIP and Brotli are fantastic at optimising similar strings, so that's a non-issue.*

## How to get started

There are a lot of different articles out there explaining how to use tailwind with Gatsby and React, many of which I was personally unhappy with, running a separate process to build your CSS, altering build scripts or setting tailwind up in combination with emotion. So I decided to write my own.

#### 1. Installing dependencies

```sh
$ yarn add tailwindcss gatsby-plugin-postcss gatsby-plugin-purgecss
$ yarn add --dev postcss-import autoprefixer
```

#### 2. Setup postcss + purgecss in gatsby-config.js

Add the following to your `gatsby-config.js` file.

```
{
  resolve: `gatsby-plugin-postcss`,
  options: {
    postCssPlugins: [
      require("postcss-import"),
      require("tailwindcss"),
      require("autoprefixer"),
    ],
  },
},
{
  resolve: `gatsby-plugin-purgecss`,
  options: {
    printRejected: true, // Print removed selectors and processed file names
    develop: false, // Enable while using `gatsby develop`
    tailwind: true, // Enable tailwindcss support
  },
},
```

#### 3. Create tailwind config

Run this in the root of your project to create your tailwind config file. Here you can [override and extend styles or set your base font family](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) etc.

```sh
$ npx tailwindcss init
```

#### 5. Setup `src/styles/app.css`

Setup your stylesheet for your application and import in your main layout file so it is required on every page.

```css
/* src/styles/app.css */
@import "tailwindcss/base";

@import "tailwindcss/components";

@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

```jsx
/* src/components/layout.js */
import "../styles/app.css"
```

## Reusing styles by creating components

Creating your design system or components allows you to easily build UIs for new pages or features. Over time you’ll build up a tonne of styled components and creating a new page is effortless.

I personally like to keep my components similar to how they work in standard HTML, using a lot of custom attributes means you need to keep re-referencing files to see how they work.

```jsx
// src/components/Button.js
import React from "react"

const Button = ({ children, className, ...rest}) => {
  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      className={`px-3 py-2 rounded bg-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-800 text-white font-medium text-lg ${className}`}
      {...rest}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}

export default Button
```

Using your new button is easy.

```jsx
// src/pages/index.js
import Layout from "../components/Layout"
import Button from "../components/Button"

const IndexPage = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Button className="my-5">
        Subscribe
      </Button>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```
