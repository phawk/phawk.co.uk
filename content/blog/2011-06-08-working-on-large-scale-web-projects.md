As you may or may not know, I work for Crafty Devil, a web applications design company based in Belfast. We have a pet project (turning into a very large one :) ) Planzai. Working on Planzai is one of the most exciting things to do, and here’s why.

When you work on a large scale web app, you’re never done with a particular feature or UI. We are constantly seeking to improve our core features, making them easier to use, more efficient on the server, using finer code for great readability and security. Every time you have major editions to a particular section, you focus on improving the rest of that feature as it looks dated and as your skills and knowledge improve.

One main example in my case has to be JavaScript. I am constantly learning more about the language, and the more I use it, the more I love it. If used correctly JavaScript is an extremely powerful language and its features (such as closures and everything being an object, even functions) have insanely creative uses.
I cringe when I look over the javascript I wrote 3 months ago, never mind 18months ago. Coming back and re-developing old features is delightful when you can improve what you did 18months ago by almost 3x efficiency, less code, more inheritance and more reusable libraries.

Spotting improvement in yourself by these standards says a lot about the team and the approach to learning and development in your company.

Each day has its new challenges and that’s what I love. If your still working away making 4 page websites, make a little time for an application or larger scale project, you will learn a lot!
