I haven't posted anything here lately, despite me looking at a lot of cool stuff. So I guess this post is a small catchup of some of the cool things I've been learning and coding up.

## Objective-C

First up, and most recently, I ventured into xcode and started out writing out an Objective-C Mac app. My dad needed a basic monthly compound interest calculator, so I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone and try and build a mac app.

Asides from doing the old hello world tutorial several months ago, I have had no experience with Objective-C or desktop programming so it was a very interesting step forward into the unknown for myself.

The two main things that took a little bit to comprehend were:

* Linking code up to the interface, although actually turned out to be really easy once I figured out how it was done
* Memory allocation and release. I still dont know enough on the theory of this topic to know exactly what to do about memory management, I just know what I have done works and didn't show up any errors in the IDE, I think I will need to research a lot more on this topic.

You can download the source xcode project for my little compound calculator app on github and take a look. https://github.com/phawk/Compound-Calculator

## Up next is node.js

Over the past 6 months or so my JavaScript skill has improved tremedously, and I have somewhat of an affection for the language, especially considering it's history. I love having a play with new technologies and node.js is certainly one of them. For my first exposure to node I put together a very quick and simple static file web server.

## Last but not least is Ruby

As you may know I mainly program in php for everyday web development, though looking at some of the features Rails has, I wanted to give it a chance to change my mind. I have been learning bits and pieces over the last 6 months, but it has been so disjointed, I haven't really learnt anything. I thought it time to knuckle down and give Ruby on Rails a propper go.

This then led me to realise that I do in fact need to spend more time on ruby specific syntax, so running through the [ruby koans](http://rubykoans.com) did me a world of good. I shall try to think of a more substantial project to undertake in Rails soon, and no doubt will share my experiences here.
