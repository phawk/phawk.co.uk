If I were to put a label on myself within the category of engineer, that would be "technologist". I love researching and playing with the latest technologies, one of the downsides to this is that I don't get much live. I put a lot of time into learning and staying up to date, but if I were to list the products I have made lately, they could be counted on one hand.

I recently found myself looking at HTML5 AppCache, and thinking I NEED to make something using this. I caught myself on a few days later and realised how absurd this sounded, I wanted to use a technical solution to solve a problem in a non-existent idea. I need to cut this attitude out and start looking for problems to solve before even thinking about solutions.

I am learning that being a maker is much more than being a good engineer / designer and knowing the tools. Even having a good sense of business and knowledge of the industry is not enough. You need a desire to build, a will to deploy. Getting your apps or projects you tinker with on your machine onto the web for others to see or use should be a strong motivation for me, but so far I keep getting distracted. I complete 80% of one thing and I am onto the next new tech or next thing I want to play with.

From here on in, I am going to try and make things. Not simply code up something and leave it lying dorment, but build, market and test products, not because it's a new piece of tech I want to use, but because it genuinely solves a problem, or at least attempts to.

Note: Evidently I did get to use AppCache in a product, Napkin, a simple app for creating throwaway notes that [@armstrong](http://twitter.com/armstrong) and I have been tinkering with.
