Picked up a new camera today, a [Sony SLT-A37](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-Translucent-Technology-Interchangeable-18-55mm/dp/B0083RQAYM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360529554&sr=8-1). I've only taken a few quick shots from the balcony in my apartment, but so far it seems pretty good.

The SLT-A37 is a new range from Sony that has an electronic viewfinder, feels a bit strange at first, but it really took the guesswork out of setting the exposure as you can see instantly the result of changing the aperture and shutter speed around.

### Update **15th Feb 2013**

I got a new [35mm f/1.8](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-Alpha-SAL35F18-A-mount-Angle/dp/B003XU4B4A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360888461&sr=8-1) lens and retook the same photo, this time I think the results are a lot better compared to the [last one](http://www.flickr.com/photos/30467190@N05/8462927564/in/photostream). I don't think the better results are all down to the lens though, the framing and ISO settings have made it a lot sharper.

The photo above was taken with a shutter speed of 1 sec, f/2.8 and ISO 100, pretty happy with the outcome. You can see it in [higher quality on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/30467190@N05/8474980436/sizes/h/in/photostream/).
